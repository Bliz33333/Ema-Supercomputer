From Hackerrank:

Ema built a quantum computer! Help her test its capabilities by solving the problem below.

Given a grid of size , each cell in the grid is either good or bad.

A valid plus is defined here as the crossing of two segments (horizontal and vertical) of equal lengths. These lengths must be odd, and the middle cell of its horizontal segment must cross the middle cell of its vertical segment.

In the diagram below, the blue pluses are valid and the orange ones are not valid.

Find the two valid pluses that can be drawn on good cells in the grid, and print an integer denoting the maximum product of their areas.
